# About

Daily Grind is an app to that utilises a fully scalable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to handle large
volumes of transaction data for Super Cafe. This pipeline will collect all the transaction data generated by each individual café and place it
in a single server. By being able to easily query the company's data as a whole, the client will drastically increase their ability to identify company-wide trends and insights.
