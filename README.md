# About Us

Daily Grind is an app to that utilises a fully scalable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to handle large
volumes of transaction data for Super Cafe. This pipeline will collect all the transaction data generated by each individual café and place it
in a single server. By being able to easily query the company's data as a whole, the client will drastically increase their ability to identify company-wide trends and insights.


#Elevator Pitch

For Super Cafe:
Who - want to target new and existing customers and also understand what products are selling well. They want to access data from different stores and use that data to identify trends within the sales.

The Super cafe website:
Is a  - A website that allows the client to view data to help grow their business.
That - Allows the client to view customer trends and data from different shops.
Unlike - Mini project app where we had no trends or existing data.
Our Product - Will allow client to view trends due to the ETL pipelines. 

# Scope
Time - Limited time to do the project as we only have 5/6 weeks, therefore focus on the key requirements. The availability of the team (1).
Quality - Functional code with unit testing (2).
Budget - Resources given by the instructors during the program (1).
Scope - Must be able to read, transform, upload and transfer data from each branch to a database so the client can increase the product sales and be able to grow their business from viewing the trends (3/4).

# MoSCoW

Must Have -
Basic CLI for client input and output.
Read existing data from the CSV files .
Store, upload and transform data for the CSV files.
AWS Database and build ETL pipelines.
Docker Compose.
Python Code.
Agile.
Git Hub.
Visualise the data using graphs - Jupyter.

Should Have - 
Easy to read CLI for the user.
Normalise the data.

Could Have - 
Another website for client interface.
Draw a plan of our project so the team are all on the same page.
Being able to remove sensitive data.
Login for security.
Improve the access to the data for the client(connection between products and branches).

Won't Have - 
Extracted data that we don't need.
Each branch won’t have the transformed data, only management team etc. of the client.

# Command line for instalations
How to set up a Python 3.10 environment for the Final Project (Windows, GitBash):

1.) Download Python 3.10 latest version to your computer and install it.

2.) Setup a new virtual environment in VsCode using GitBash:

		- Open the daily-grind-final-project folder in VsCode
		
		- Create a virtual environment: 
		```
		<py -3.10 -m venv .venv>
		```
		- Activate it: 
		```
		<source .venv/Scripts/activate>
		```

Creating a branch:
Open a Git Bash terminal in the daily-grind-final-project directory

To create a branch enter:
```
$ git branch and name the branch the Trello ticket number eg. $ git branch 8. Updating README file
```

To move into the new branch enter:
```
$ git checkout <name of branch> 
```

Enter $ git push --set-upstream origin <name of branch> 

Add, Commit and push the branch to the main repository. Check Github the branch is on the Git repository. 

Pull Request: 
When we have finished writing our code and want to merge it we will carry out a pull request and assign the scrum master to review the code. 

Merging:
Once the scrum master and the team are happy with the code we will merge the code
Enter $ git checkout main to return to the main branch 
Enter $ git pull on your local repository

Deleting a Branch: 
The branch will be deleted once the ticket is complete 
Enter  $ git - - delete <name of branch>
